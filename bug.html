<div class="flex">
  <div class="w-1/2 bg-gray-200"></div>
  <div class="w-1/2 bg-gray-200"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS to create a flexbox layout with two equal-width columns. However, if the content of the second column is longer than the content of the first, the second column will wrap to the next line, breaking the layout.

This is because by default, Tailwind's flexbox containers do not prevent the wrapping of child elements.
